## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Expertise

This project intentionally avoids all major frameworks (React, Bootstrap, etc.) to highlight mastery of core web technologies and advanced markup techniques.

| Language | Focus Area | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Semantic Markup, Accessibility (`aria-hidden`, `alt` tags) | Emphasis on structural clarity and SEO best practices. |
| **Sass (SCSS)** | **Modular Architecture**, Scalability, **Clean Code**, **Cross-browser Compatibility** | Styles are organized using a structure similar to the **7-1 Pattern**, featuring dedicated folders for `abstracts`, `components`, and `layouts` to ensure **maintainability** and **support**. Styles are verified to ensure consistent rendering across major platforms and modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). |
| **Vanilla JavaScript** | ES6+, Modules, DOM Manipulation | Implementation of robust, framework-agnostic logic for core features. |
